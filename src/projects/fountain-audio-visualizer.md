title: Fountain Audio Visualizer
date: September - December 2012
---

For Olin's Principles of Engineering project, I worked on a small team to create a fountain that dances to music. I had two roles on the team. I was in charge of writing the Arduino code that interfaced with the Python GUI and the electrical system and I wrote the Python code that parsed through a media file, using an FFT to find the relative powers of each frequency range present, and then convert these powers to PWM signals to send over a serial to the Arduino.

The final project is demostrated in the video below.

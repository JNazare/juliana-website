title: How to Make (Almost) Anything
---

For my How to Make (Almost) Anything final project, I decided to make a "phone-like" object that allows people to dial a number via Skype. The goal is to give this to my grandma as a holiday present, so that she can Skype with her brother in San Diego. Check out a video demo of the working phone:

Creating this working phone took me a good part of a week, and I have tried to [document my process here](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/juliana_nazare/final_project.html).

Thanks to Bianca Datta help troubleshooting the Makerbot, Palash Nandy for help troubleshooting the Arduino Leonardo, and Felix Heibeck for his suggestion to use keystrokes and supplying the ATMEGA32U4 chip.

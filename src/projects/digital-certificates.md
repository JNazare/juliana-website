title: Digital Certificates
date: June 2015 - Present

I am currently working on a research project to create certificates can be issued digitally in an immediately-verifiable format that conveys a learner's community membership instead of a checklist of their skills. To issue a certificate, the issuing institution puts a hash of the certificate at time of issuance on a globally decentralized public ledger called the blockchain. Someone who is attempting to verify a person's expertise can then find this hash on the blockchain and instantly verify that the certificate is in fact the same as the one given to the recipient by the issuing institution.

My contributions to this project have been to write the code to create and issue these certificates on the Bitcoin blockchain, work with implementation partners to make the system robust enough for pilots of the certificates, and create the backend for the webapp that allows users to view and verify their certificates.

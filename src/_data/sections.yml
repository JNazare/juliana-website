    I am a master's student in the MIT Media Lab's [Lifelong Kindergarten Group](http://llk.media.mit.edu) and an alum of [Olin College of Engineering](http://olin.edu), where I studied electrical and computer engineering. Before coming to the Media Lab, I worked part-time at MIT Lincoln Labs in the Human Language Technology Group and was a Technical Associate at Startup Institute Boston. I am interested in using computer science to build educational experiences that help people learn about themselves, their communities, and the world around them.
